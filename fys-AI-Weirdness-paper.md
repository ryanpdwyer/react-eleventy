Here is another video on [Google Cloud Vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eve8DkkVdhI) and the link to the [adversarial model](http://runwayml.com/?utm_source=runwayml&utm_medium=generative_engine&utm_campaign=experiments) I used.
See the example on page 200 of the book for another good adversarial attack on Google Cloud Vision.

### Images?

Yes, if you have any examples that would benefit from including images, please include them! That's why the length is again a word limit rather than a page limit.


### Citing sources

Cite your sources in the text using a parenthetical format such as MLA. If you already know and prefer APA form, that is fine too.

For MLA format, in-text citations use the format (Author, page). Here is a link to the [rules](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_in_text_citations_the_basics.html).

You should also have a list of Works Cited or References at the end of the document, [formatted as explained here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html), which is easiest to do with [ZoteroBib](https://zbib.org) (make sure the style is set to Modern Language Association = MLA).

Here's an example:

  <div class="card-body">

Shane's first principle of AI Weirdness is that AI is more likely to be too dumb than too smart (4). For example, an AI recipe generator has trouble keeping track of the ingredients list and remembering exactly what dish it is supposed to be making when writing the instructions (Shane, 52).

The first time, only the page number is needed because the text is introduced using the author's name. If the author's name isn't stated, it should be included in the parentheses.
