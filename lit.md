# Tools for searching, managing, and citing scientific literature 

August 23, 2019, Dr. Ryan Dwyer

## Searching scientific literature
There are many sources listed on the library's [Chemistry Resources](https://www.mountunion.edu/academics/library/chemistry-resources) page. The library page allows off-campus access to SciFinder after you are registered.

- [SciFinder](https://login.mt.opal-libraries.org/login?url=https://scifinder.cas.org/scifinder/login?TYPE=33554433&REALMOID=06-b7b15cf0-642b-1005-963a-830c809fff21&GUID=&SMAUTHREASON=0&METHOD=GET&SMAGENTNAME=-SM-wNXZ1RZQlZLQYv7NUS67HRPrsFE4zQPPc65bhKZLnR6OPJ9%2bos7bfMIDylPOZvbo&TARGET=-SM-http%3a%2f%2fscifinder%2ecas%2eorg%3a443%2fscifinder%2f) The best way to search for specific molecules - very comprehensive in chemistry and related fields.
    - To sign up, [register here](https://login.mt.opal-libraries.org/login?url=https://scifinder.cas.org/registration/index.html?corpKey=E530CBEA-86F3-50AB-7B49-7B248AED8219). Users must complete a self registration form using a "@mountunion.edu" email address. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOW-UP EMAIL AND FOLLOW DIRECTIONS TO ACCESS SciFinder.

## Reference management software
Reference management software tracks, manages, and organizes scientific papers, books, and web pages. The references can be cited in a lab report or paper, and the reference management software correctly numbers the citations and generates the bibliography. I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). Another option is [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/reference-manager).
Either way, the software has three components:

1.  An application containing a list of your articles, books, and other sources with different options for organizing, searching, and sorting. In Zotero, this looks like
<img class="img-fluid" alt="Zotero" src="/img/zotero.png">
The references can be sorted into collections (the folder symbols), tagged with keywords, and searched.
2.  A web browser plug-in that can (usually) download papers and create a reference from an article’s webpage. For Zotero, this icon changes depending on the webpage. If Zotero knows how to automatically import the article, it appears as a document icon:
<img class="img-fluid" alt="Zotero plug-in" src="/img/zotero-web-extension.png">
For an overview of how to import items into Zotero, see [Getting stuff into your library](https://www.zotero.org/support/getting_stuff_into_your_library). Note: For Mac users, Zotero is not currently compatible with Safari—you have to use Chrome or Firefox instead.
3.  A plug-in for Word so that references and bibliographies can be imported and managed *automatically* (using the correct citation style, automatic numbering, etc...). In Zotero, this appears as its own menu in the ribbon:
<img class="img-fluid" alt="Zotero word plug-in" src="/img/zotero-word.png">
with options for adding citations, adding a bibliography, and preferences for managing how the citations and bibliography appear. For more information, see [Using the Zotero Word Plugin](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_usage).


For a more general overview of Zotero's features, see the [Quick Start Guide](https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide). For other questions, see the complete [documentation](https://www.zotero.org/support/start) (or feel free to ask me).


## Searching scientific literature

[SciFinder](https://scifinder.cas.org/)

[Web of Science](http://www.webofknowledge.com/)

Both can be used for **foward literature searches,** looking systematically at which other articles cite a particular paper. This will be very useful for your literature review---you can see where a field has gone since a particular important paper. In SciFinder, use Get Related Citations > Get Citing:

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/scifinder-forward-search.png" alt="SciFinder forward literature search">

In Web of Science, use the Times Cited box:

<img class="img-fluid" alt="Web of Science" src="/img/web-of-science-forward-search.png">

From there, the citations can be systematically analyzed, and refined in various ways. This can be an especially useful technique for a paper that helped launch a new field or sub-field (like Frances Arnold's paper ["Tuning the activity of an enzyme for unusual environments: sequential random mutagenesis of subtilisin E for catalysis in dimethylformamide,"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.90.12.5618) the first paper demonstrating directed evolution, for which she won half of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry). Since future papers in the field should always cite this original work, the cited references can help you see the current state of the field.


### Accessing sources off-campus

<a href="javascript:void(location.href=%22http://mt.opal-libraries.org/login?url=%22+location.href);">UMU proxy</a>

Drag the link above to the bookmark toolbar or on mobile devices, bookmark any page, and edit the address by pasting in the following (including the semicolon at the end):

    javascript:void(location.href=%22http://mt.opal-libraries.org/login?url=%22+location.href);

To use the bookmarklet, nagivate to the journal article or off-campus resource you want to use, then click the bookmarklet to re-direct through the Mount Union library proxy.


### Looking up articles by citation

[Crossref](https://search.crossref.org/) is very useful for this (Google has gotten much better at this, but still sometimes fails to find the correct citation). Just paste the citation, and it should return the correct article at or near the top of the search results.
