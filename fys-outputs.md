# Building an AI Project: Interesting Outputs

## Goals

- Connect your AI model to different outputs
- Modify the outputs, which requires programming (in contrast to machine learning / AI)

## Teachable Machine Models


- Make sure you have a url from [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). Export Model, then "Upload my Model", then copy the resulting link:

### Web Output Program Examples

Note that the title indicates which type of model will work; for example, pose models require a Teachable machine pose model.
