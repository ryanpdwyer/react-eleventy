# Introduction to AI

**Goals:** Introduce key AI tools and concepts.

## Turing Test Game

[TuringTestChat](https://www.turingtestchat.com/home)

**Goals:**

1. Identify if you are chatting with a human or bot (always).

2. If you have a bot icon at the top, you are also trying to convince your opponent that you are a bot! (and can win points for deceiving your opponent).

**Log-in or write down your results to keep track of your score:** The most points after 10 minutes wins the right to skip a written reflection.


# Generative AI

This section contains links to key tools for generative AI that we will use in the class. Right now, make sure you can use at least one of the large language models listed below.


## Large language models: ChatGPT and company

1. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) You will need to sign up for a free account.

2. [Bing AI](https://www.bing.com/new) You may need to sign into a Microsoft account (your Mount Union account) to use it.

    (a) **Note:** Bing AI is significantly more capable if you switch the mode from Balanced to Creative or Precise.

3. [Bard](https://bard.google.com/) Sign in with a google account and accept its terms of service.

**Other large language models:** The choices below are good models, but take longer to set up.



1. Bing AI sidebar in Microsoft Edge.
    (a) [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download) First, download, install, and open Microsoft Edge.
    (b) **Using the Microsoft Edge browser,** go to https://www.bing.com. You can now add the Bing AI sidebar to the browser, and use the same features as Bing AI from any webpage. This version of Bing AI is capable of longer questions / answers and can read information on your current webpage.
2. [Claude](https://claude.ai/login) Another relatively good model.


## Image generation

1. [Bing, DALL-E](https://www.bing.com/create) Bing will generate images based on text prompts.

Many other tools are available - see [One Useful Thing blog post](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/i/134642483/make-images).



<!-- ### Getting to know your classmates

With someone next to you, ask the AI model questions about each other. -->

# Writing with AI Assignment


**Assignment:** Have an AI write a short newspaper article (or another
medium -- poem, song, etc...) describing a recent fictional event that
occurred at Mount Union. Make sure the article includes a good title.

**Goals:** The goal is for you and your partner to come up with the most creative possible fictional event and make the AI write the most entertaining and funny,
article (or poem, song, etc) possible about it. This will also be an opportunity to learn more about what the AI is good and bad at.


**Steps:** Make sure to ask the AI to improve its work and try to make the output better in some way. Some ideas:

-   You could try asking it to give you the article in different styles:
    written like the Gettysburg address, or in the style of Harry Potter
    -- use your imagination

-   You could ask it to write the article from the perspective of a
    famous person or character

-   Ask it to write a poem or a song

Talk with your partner about what the best articles / results are. Think
about the AI's

-   Organization

-   Writing quality

-   Creativity and originality

Take it with a grain of salt, but think about the AI's

-   Sources / evidence

-   Factual accuracy (again, aside from the fictional event)

**Output:** When you're done

- paste your article into the [class Word
doc](https://mountunion-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/dwyerry_mountunion_edu/EXr7jd1pYi9Iu2xqVCSqdvYBwbswv4c8NSUa7uihRc8NOA?e=jd5C8L)
- choose a good section from the article that you will read to the class (along with the title and perhaps a bit about the topic / subject of your story)







<!-- #### Notes - Getting to know your classmates example



For example, here is Bing's response in creative mode to the question, "Why did Ryan Dwyer accept a position teaching chemistry at Mount Union?"

Hello, this is Bing. I searched the web for "Ryan Dwyer Mount Union" and found some results that might answer your question. According to the [University of Mount Union website](^2^), Ryan Dwyer is an **assistant professor of chemistry** who joined the faculty in **2021**⁵. He has a **Ph.D. in chemistry** from the **University of Michigan** and a **B.S. in chemistry** from the **University of Notre Dame**⁵. He teaches courses in **general chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry**⁵. 

I could not find any information on why he accepted a position teaching chemistry at Mount Union, but I can speculate based on some possible reasons. Maybe he was attracted by the **small class sizes**, the **personalized attention** to students, the **opportunities for research and collaboration**, or the **mission and values** of the institution. Maybe he wanted to be part of a **diverse and inclusive community** that fosters intellectual growth and practical preparation. Maybe he had a **personal connection** to Mount Union or the Alliance area. Or maybe he just liked the **purple and white colors** of the Raiders.

Of course, these are just my guesses. The best way to find out why he chose Mount Union is to ask him directly. You can contact him by email at dwyerr@mountunion.edu or by phone at (330) 823-XXXX⁵. I hope this helps you with your inquiry. 😊
