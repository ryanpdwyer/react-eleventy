# A1: Setting up your computer

### Goals

- Install software that will help you get started building your own AI applications.
- Use screenshot software-this will be very useful to share your work and diagnose bugs going forward!


Here are instructions for installing the applications you'll need in this class on your computer. If you have a Mac, go [here](#mac).

## Windows

If you have any installation issues, take a screenshot (Win+Shift+S or the Snipping tool) showing the problem and include it in your assignment.

Create a Microsoft Word document with your name at the top. Show that you've installed the applications by pasting the following **3** screenshots into a Word document:

1. To show Word is installed,
	- On Windows, click on the File ribbon, then the account tab, and take a screenshot. 
	- On Mac, go to Word > About (in the menu bar at the top of the screen), and take a screenshot.

  Paste the screenshot into your document. (Don't know how to take a screenshot? Click here for <button class="btn btn-link" onclick="show('windows-screenshot-2'); hide('mac-screenshot-2')">Windows</button> / <button class="btn btn-link" onclick="show('mac-screenshot-2'); hide('windows-screenshot-2')">Mac</button> )

2. To show that you have Wekinator installed, launch the application and paste a screenshot of the screen that shows up in your document:

![Wekinator inputs screen](/img/fys-wekinator.png)

3. **To show that you have Processing and the Wekinator Example Bundle, open processing and the file `welcome` in the `wekinator_examples/welcome` folder. Press the Play button, enter your name, and paste a screenshot of the window that shows up in your document:**

![Processing welcome screen](/img/welcome-picture.png)


Here's an example of me doing all three on Windows:

4. **If you had any issues installing/opening any of the applications, include a screenshot showing your problem, and/or contact me via [email](mailto:dwyerry@mountunion.edu). We can make sure you get everything installed correctly for the next class meeting.**
