## Goals

- Connect real-world examples of AI doom to the principles of AI weirdness and Signs of AI doom introduced earlier.


### Reading

- Shane Chapter 4: It's trying!

### Writing

**Prompt:** Discuss one of the examples discussed under the different headings in the chapter, making connections to any of the AI Weirdness principles or Signs of AI doom:
- Problem too broad
- More data, please
- Messy data
- Time-wasting data
- Is this the real life?
- Other dataset quirks
- Missing data
- There are four giraffes

Alternatively, focus on one of the key terms introduced in this chapter: data augmentation, unintentional memorization, or visual priming.
