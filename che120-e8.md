# E8 pH titration

**Report:** This is an analytical report, so you just need your data, figures, calculations and answers to the questions from the lab manual on pages 97-98. 

## Sample plot and Example

The graph below shows the pH versus volume of titrant added for the titration of 0.223 grams of a weak base with 0.100 M HCl. The base and acid react according to the net ionic equation  B(aq) + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(aq) ⟶ HB⁺(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l).

<!-- ## Conceptional Question Help

This should provide some help with questions 7-9:

- Remember the differences between strong acids and weak acids; we don't list K<sub>a</sub> for strong acids because they ionize/dissociate completely. To determine the pK<sub>a</sub> of the acid, we need to use the equation pH = pK<sub>a</sub> + log([base]/[acid]) at the half-equivalence point (where pH = pK<sub>a</sub>, assuming that equation applies). -->
