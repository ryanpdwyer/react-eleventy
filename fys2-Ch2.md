### Reading

- Shane Chapter 2: AI is everywhere, but where is it exactly?


### Assignment

For Wednesday, we won't do a full reflection. Just answer these questions in a Word doc.

1. Briefly (2-3 sentences) explain **one** of the key terms introduced in this chapter, such as:
    - Deepfakes
    - Transfer learning
    - The Turing test
    - Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) versus Artificial general intelligence (AGI)
    - One-shot learning
    - Recurrent neural networks
2. Briefly (2-3 sentences) explain **one** of these two key observations about AIs from the chapter. In your answer, refer to one or more of the signs of AI Doom or principles of AI weirdness.
    - The narrower the task, the smarter the AI
    - AIs have issues with long-term memory and planning. See the annotated recipe on page 52 for an example. 
3. What's something interesting or surprising you learned from this chapter?
4. What's a question you have, or something that's unclear?
