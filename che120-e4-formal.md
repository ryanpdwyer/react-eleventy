# E1 What's in the Water?

In this lab, you will identify unknown pollutants in a sample of water using infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

The video below has information about the experimental procedure used to collect the spectra.

## Formal Lab Report

Once your lab instructor has confirmed that you have successfully identified your unknowns, you are ready to write the formal lab report for this experiment.
Your report will need to include 

**Abstract**: The purpose, a little bit about the procedure, and the key results of the experiment.

**Experimental:** A short paragraph (2-3 sentences) with key experimental details about how the spectra were collected (what instrument, etc). See the video above for this information.

**Results:** This section will include

- **Tables:** Copy the completed tables from your results worksheet or the blank tables from [this document](https://mountunion.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/CHE120Lab2/EcRcYjj9C-RLpIlXpYulzCgBe_Z3syZWYxIwbQtWI05MQA?e=LKTnR6).
    - Remember to add labels and titles: **Table 1. Descriptive Title, Table 2. Another descriptive title**, etc.

- **Figures:** The IR and NMR spectra of your unknowns.
    - Remember to add captions with numbers and titles: **Figure 1. IR Spectrum of 32345**, **Figure 2. NMR Spectrum of 32345**, etc.
    - **How to add spectra**: On Windows, take screenshots using Win+Shift+S (see [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_0gcVRenXM) for help).
    
        On Mac, use Preview and the Rectangular select tool or take a screenshot using âŒ˜+Ctrl+Shift+4 (copies to clipboard - see [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEE-EEfW204) for help).

- **Paragraphs of text** guiding the reader through the tables and figures, explaining what is contained in each. "The data in Figures 1-3 and the IR peak table from the lab manual<sup>1</sup> were used to determine the functional groups..."

You should also **identify the unknowns.**

**Discussion**: Discuss the points below from the lab manual in **paragraphs of text.** Remember to use a new paragraph for each new idea.

1. Provide a full explanation of how you determined the identity of each unknown compound, citing specific examples from your results.  In particular, is there any ambiguity or uncertainty in the identification of an unknown?  (i.e. Were you able to narrow it to two or three compounds but no further?).  Be sure to cite specific evidence (specific IR peaks) from your data tables and figures (spectra) to facilitate your discussion.  

2. Briefly discuss the implications of the presence of each of the compounds that you identified in the drinking water supply and any potential human health effects. **You will need to cite outside sources here in ACS Style.**

3. Briefly discuss the implications of the presence of each of the compounds that you identified in the surface waters and any potential environmental effects. **You will need to cite outside sources here in ACS Style.**

**References:** Reference the lab handout (including the three lab instructors as authors) and sources you consulted to discuss human health and environmental impacts of the three compounds you identified (at least **3** outside sources).
