# Introduction to AI

**Goals:** Introduce key AI tools and concepts.

## Turing Test Game

[TuringTestChat](https://www.turingtestchat.com/home)

**Goals:**

1. Identify if you are chatting with a human or bot (always).

2. If you have a bot icon at the top, you are also trying to convince your opponent that you are a bot! (and can win points for deceiving your opponent).

**Log-in or write down your results to keep track of your score:** The most points after 10 minutes wins the right to skip a written reflection.




## Large language models: ChatGPT and company

1. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) You will need to sign up for a free account.

2. [Bing AI](https://www.bing.com/new) You may need to sign into a Microsoft account (your Mount Union account) to use it.
    (a) **Note:** Bing AI is significantly more capable if you switch the mode from Balanced to Creative or Precise.

3. [Bard](https://bard.google.com/) Sign in with a google account and accept its terms of service.

#### Notes - Getting to know your classmates example



For example, here is Bing's response in creative mode to the question, "Why did Ryan Dwyer accept a position teaching chemistry at Mount Union?"

Hello, this is Bing. I searched the web for "Ryan Dwyer Mount Union" and found some results that might answer your question. According to the [University of Mount Union website](^2^), Ryan Dwyer is an **assistant professor of chemistry** who joined the faculty in **2021**‚Åµ. He has a **Ph.D. in chemistry** from the **University of Michigan** and a **B.S. in chemistry** from the **University of Notre Dame**‚Åµ. He teaches courses in **general chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry**‚Åµ. 

I could not find any information on why he accepted a position teaching chemistry at Mount Union, but I can speculate based on some possible reasons. Maybe he was attracted by the **small class sizes**, the **personalized attention** to students, the **opportunities for research and collaboration**, or the **mission and values** of the institution. Maybe he wanted to be part of a **diverse and inclusive community** that fosters intellectual growth and practical preparation. Maybe he had a **personal connection** to Mount Union or the Alliance area. Or maybe he just liked the **purple and white colors** of the Raiders.

Of course, these are just my guesses. The best way to find out why he chose Mount Union is to ask him directly. You can contact him by email at dwyerr@mountunion.edu or by phone at (330) 823-XXXX‚Åµ. I hope this helps you with your inquiry. üòä
