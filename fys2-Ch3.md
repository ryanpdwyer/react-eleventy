### Goals


- Describe common machine learning algorithms and strategies


**Why is this important?** The "learning" isn't magic - computers are still just blindly following your directions.

### Reading

- Shane Chapter 3: How does it actually learn?

### Writing

The prompt is meant to guide your reading and reflection-you are free to choose any of these bullet points as the basis of your reflection or to focus on another area of the book that you found interesting, surprising, funny, unexpected, etc. **Your reflections should be 1 page long double-spaced (12 point font size, Times New Roman, 1-inch margins, etc).**

**Title and Header: ** Include a descriptive / engaging title and your name in the header or at the top of the page.

**Prompts:** Discuss one of the examples of AI and machine learning discussed in the chapter, including any interesting applications, anything you learned, or anything about our AI Weirdness principles / Signs of AI Doom that's relevant
- Neural networks
- Markov chains (feel free to try some of the experiments using your phone's auto-correct; however, this has been changed to a transformer-based model for current phones)
- Random forests
- Evolutionary algorithms
- Generative adversarial networks (GANs)

As usual, feel free to reflect on something else of interest if you prefer!

### What is a good reflection?

A good reflection will be organized and well-written. What is well-written? Check that your reflection 

- Is understandable to your audience, your fellow classmates
- Develops logically, using effective and smooth transitions
- Engages the reader, making points clearly and concisely
- Citations: The book can be cited in APA style as (Shane, 2019, p. 23).  

Also, check to make sure your reflection avoids these **critical mistakes:**

1) Sentence fragments (incomplete sentences)
2) Run-on sentences (comma splices and fused sentences)
3) Sentence sprawl (Long sentences that contain many clauses which makes it hard to infer the meaning that the writer is trying to get across because all of those extra words and clauses get in the way of the reader's comprehension-like this sentence!)

Also check for basic spelling errors, typos, and capitalization errors.

  These are the class's Gateway Criteria - see the handout from class or the link for more detail. If you have more than two of these mistakes per page, the assignment will be given back ungraded until you correct them.

### AI Policy

Feel free to use AI tools for brainstorming, or to bounce ideas off on, or at the proofreading / revision stage to identify errors or points where you can improve your writing. Note that use of AI tools needs to be cited (see [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt))and **double-checked** for accuracy. Your reflection is also not effective if it is largely direct quotes from a large language model - we want to hear your thoughts on the reading.


**Bring 3 printed copies of your reflection to class.** Remember that Papercut is how to print on campus - see the Technology 101 handout for instructions on how to print on campus.
