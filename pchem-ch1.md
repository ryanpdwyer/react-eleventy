### Goals

- Use "randomly shuffled cards" model and probability to determine equilibrium composition for isotope exchange reactions



### Video

Note: The same content is covered in the book, Chapter 1 pages 6-13. Use the book and/or the video (whichever you prefer) to get an initial handle on this topic.

Wednesday in class, we will finish chapter 1 and give you time to work through most of [Assignment 1](https://d2l.mountunion.edu/d2l/le/content/35180/viewContent/413549/View) (the homework due Friday).
