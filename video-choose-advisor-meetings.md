# Research pitch

Hi, I'm Dr. Ryan Dwyer and I have two projects that I'd be excited to have you work on for your senior research. 

Second, I'm interested in understanding how students learn in virtual lab environments.

- Virtual labs and uncertainty?
- Virtual labs and titrations, Acid, Buffer, Eq. Pt., excess base...
- Use virtual lab to emphasize concepts...
- Lots of opportunities for instant feedback, lower cognitive load
- Assess: Virtual, what is a titration? Do the virtual titration, then switch to the in-person lab versus... In-person titration lab (do everything...), then virtual lab ()
    - Assessment piece tied to V9 (one/two weeks after virtual lab, should be some sort of learning curve in place...how many hints/tries do students need?)
    - Hard to see effects...


When it comes to education research, one big problem is how to assess how well your
