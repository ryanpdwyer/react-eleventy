# Project - Building an AI Model Overview

**Next:** See [Building an AI Model Project W4 details](/fys-V07-23) for an overview of the whole project and the list of all the different potential inputs (and some of the potential outputs).

We'll be working on this project until fall break.

### Goals

- Build a model using a more complex input
- Evaluate your model by comparing and contrasting the performance of multiple versions of the model
- Clearly describe, demonstrate, and evaluate your model in a written paper and oral presentation

### Video

Here are some of the possible inputs you could use:

<h4>Wekinator Machine</h4>

To follow along with the first video, install Wekinator Machine by downloading here: [Windows](https://github.com/ryanpdwyer/wekinator-machine2/releases/download/v2.0/wekinator-machine-2.0-windows.Setup.exe) or [Mac](https://github.com/ryanpdwyer/wekinator-machine2/releases/download/v2.0/wekinator-machine-2.0-mac-arm64.zip). For help completing the installation, see the video below:

### Potential Inputs

See the list of potential inputs (discussed in the video) below. 

<div class="randomize-list">

- [Teachable Machine: Pose Model](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com)
- [Teachable Machine: Image Classifier](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com). See [Teachable Machine 1: Image Classification](https://youtu.be/kwcillcWOg0) for more information.
- [Teachable Machine: Audio Model](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com). See [Teachable Machine 3: Sound Classification](https://youtu.be/TOrVsLklltM) for more information.
- [Teachable Machine V1:](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/v1/) Nice built-in control of the output
- Wekinator Machine: Pose Model	[See the web demo](https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/demos/posenet/camera.html) or see [Teachable Machine Pose Model](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com).
- Wekinator Machine: Face Model. [Google demo](https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/demos/facemesh/index.html) or [Glitch demo](https://networked-facemesh-3js-tf2.glitch.me/)
- Wekinator Machine: Hand or Palm Model. [Google demo](https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/demos/handtrack/index.html) or [Glitch demo](https://networked-hand-3js-tf174-handv1.glitch.me/). 
- iOS: [MotionSender](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/motionsender/id1315005698) This works to send accelerometer, gyroscope, and attitude (tilt, orientation...) as inputs.

### Potential outputs

Think about what you want your model to do - it should be pretty clear whether you need classifier, continuous (regression), or gesture recognition ([dynamic time warping outputs](/fys-V05-23)). If you're not sure, let me know and I can give you feedback via D2L, in-class or office hours.

Beyond just what outputs, think about what will make your model appealing - is there a way to tweak one of our Processing outputs to do something more interesting?

### Harder Topics

<div class="randomize-list">

- Android: [Sensors2OSC](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.sensors2.osc/) or [OSCHook](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hollyhook.oscHook&hl=en_US&showAllReviews=true)
- Build your own Processing input: Feel free to try this if you feel comfortable modifying some of the Java Processing Code!
- [XBox 360, PS4 or other USB controllers](https://gist.github.com/drscotthawley/dd74db91dd2f8ec3c810a87d4d26b576). I haven't tried this - it make take a little bit of work to get everything set up.
- [LeapMotion Hand Tracking](https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/) via [Processing](http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas01rf/WekinatorDownloads/wekinator_examples/all_source_zips/LeapMotionViaProcessing.zip) I have one available if you are interested.

## A4 Due Tuesday September 12

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" markdown=1>
Submit your answers on D2L under <a target="_blank" href="https://d2l.mountunion.edu/d2l/le/content/54369/viewContent/820927/View">A4 Build an AI Project Topic</a>
</div>

1. What model would you like to build? What will it do?
2. What kind of inputs could you use (from the list above: Teachable Machine Image, Teachable Machine Audio, Wekinator Machine Face...)?
    What kind of outputs (classification, regression, dynamic time warping...)?
3. What different or modified project/model would you be interested in? (This could be something completely different, or just a small variation - it's good to have some backup plans if there is something that won't work out for your first choice).
4. What was unclear, or what is one remaining question you have?
