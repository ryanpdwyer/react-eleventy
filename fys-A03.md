## Goals

- Practice writing and editing
- Connect AI / machine learning theory to applications

# A3: Discussion post: Classifiers and Regression in the wild

Choose an application of AI / machine learning. It could be from the list of applications below or any others you can think of or find on your own. Write a discussion post that "reviews" the application:

1) Includes a descriptive title
2) Briefly explains the application and its purpose
3) Describes the AI model (what inputs? Is the output a **classifier, regression, both, or neither?** Anything interesting about how the model is "trained"?)
4) What's something interesting/frustrating about the application? (connection to what you've learned, or your other interests...)
5) links to 1 or more sources that you used (videos, websites, etc...)
6) Includes an image if appropriate.

A good post will be 1-2 well-written paragraphs. What is well-written? Check that your post 

- Is understandable to your audience, your fellow classmates
- Develops logically, using effective and smooth transitions
- Engages the reader, making points clearly and concisely

Also, check to make sure your post avoids these **critical mistakes:**

1) Sentence fragments (incomplete sentences)
2) Run-on sentences (comma splices and fused sentences)
3) Sentence sprawl (Long sentences that contain many clauses which makes it hard to infer the meaning that the writer is trying to get across because all of those extra words and clauses get in the way of the reader's comprehension-like this sentence!)

Also check for basic spelling errors, typos, capitalization errors.
