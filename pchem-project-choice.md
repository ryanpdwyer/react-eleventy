# CHE 341 Lab: Spectroscopy or Characterization Project

This page lays out the goals and possible topics for the minor project.


You are welcome to work together on a project, just make sure that you would each have a part that is yours (so one person could be mainly responsible for the UV-Vis, the other for electrochemical measurements, etc)

### Goals
- Gain an in-depth understanding of a spectroscopy or characterization technique
- Design experiments and analyze data
- Write a technical report summarizing your progress so students in future years can build on what you learned


### Timeline

- **Wednesday Sep 15** Choose a topic and talk to me briefly so we have an idea of what you want to do in lab on Thursday. I can also direct you to some other resources for your topic.
- **Thursday September 16** Prelab due (5 pts): Plan out the experiments you want to do in lab week 1 based on our conversations on Wednesday. **Give me a list of materials needed so I can have then ready for you in lab.** In lab, make sure you have a good plan for next week.
- **Tuesday Sep 21** (15 pts) Analyze data from lab on Monday, plan experiments for this week.
- **Thursday Sep 23** Finish your initial project in lab.
- **Thursday Sep 30** Wrap-up the project with
    - A short presentation on some of the background of your technique (25 pts)
        - What is your technique?
        - What is the basic theory underlying it?
    - Draft technical report summarizing your findings (100 pts for final version)


### Possible Topics

- UV-Vis absorbance spectroscopy
    - Measure the equilibrium constant of a chemical reaction (+ the effect of some other variable, like ionic strength)
    - Utilize the variable temperature add-on to measure the variation of the equilibrium constant with temperature, enabling you to determine the enthalpy change \\(\Delta H^\circ\\) and entropy change \\(\Delta S^\circ \\) for the reaction.
    - Measure the kinetics of a chemical reaction
    - Measure the activation energy of a chemical reaction
    - Time-resolved measurements: [Flash Photolysis Experiment of o-Methyl Red as a Function of pH: A Low-Cost Experiment for the Undergraduate Physical Chemistry Lab](https://doi.10.1021/acs.jchemed.6b00403)
    - Determine the mechanism of a chemical reaction
    - Characterize the stability of gold nanoparticles created over the last 3 years
- Electrochemistry
    - The EPA action level for lead in drinking water is 15 parts per billion (ppb). Using anodic stripping voltammetry, determine the limit of detection and quantification for this technique in our lab (method of standard additions). See [Screen-printed electrodes for environmental monitoring of heavy metal ions: a review](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00604-015-1651-0).
        - We have mercury-coated paper electrodes (like the carbon-coated electrodes used in lab).
        - You could also try coating a platinum or carbon electrode with a gallium-indium eutectic instead. This would be environmentally friendlier.
    - Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), or PEDOT, is a conductive polymer with electrochromic properties; depending on the applied voltage, the material can be transparent or a dark blue. Electrochemically grow a PEDOT film and investigate its properties (such as enhanced sensitivity to detect ascorbic acid).

        ![PEDOT oxidized and reduced forms](/img/pedot-ox-red.png)
    
        - PEDOT films could also be deposited by spin-coating from an aqueous or organic dispersion.
        - There are also good applications of contact angle measurements to better understand what the surfaces look like.
    - Perform an electrochemical titration.
    - Coat an electrode with gold nanoparticles and investigate its utility as a sensor.
    - Electroplate metals onto a carbon electrode, measure how much metal is deposited (team electrochemistry did most of this on Thursday), see [Metal Electrodeposition on an Integrated, Screen-Printed Electrode Assembly](https://doi.org/10.1021/ed085p565)
- Contact angle measurement
    - Modify the surface of glass, ITO, and gold materials with self-assembled monolayers or electrochemically grown layers, quantify using the contact angle.
        - Gold: [Patterning Self-Assembled Monolayers on Gold. Green Materials Chemistry in the Teaching Laboratory](https://doi.org/10.1021/ed081p545)
    - Determine the reproducibility of our contact angle setup (Â± how many degrees for a single measurement)
    - Quantify the roughness of electrochemically grown electrodes (roughness affects the contact angle)
- Stamping (contact lithography)
- Spin-coating
- Projects using multiple techniques
    - Spin-coat a \[Ru(bipy)<sub>3</sub>\]<sup>3+</sup> film and measure its electochemical and electroluminescent properties. See [Using Organic Light-Emitting Electrochemical Thin-Film Devices To Teach Materials Science](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ed081p1620).
    - [Conductive PEDOT Covalently Bound to Transparent FTO Electrodes](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp412758g)
- Polarimetry 
    - Set up a polarimeter to measure optical rotation (how much light is rotated by chiral molecules)
    - See [Low-Cost 3D-Printed Polarimeter](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.9b01083), possibly even simpler
- Set up our Raman spectrometer! Based on [Inexpensive Raman Spectrometer for Undergraduate and Graduate Experiments and Research](https://doi.org/10.1021/ed800081t)
    ![Raman spectrometer](/img/Raman-Spectrometer-Green.png)
    - Measure fluorescence of fluorescin to align the instrument
    - Use the [Tollens reaction](https://edu.rsc.org/exhibition-chemistry/the-silver-mirror-test/2020077.article) to make a nice silver-coated microscope slide
- Electrical measurements
    - Another way to measure the properties of conductive films, like PEDOT.
    - Constructing a nice 4-point probe: [Studying Electrical Conductivity Using a 3D Printed Four-Point Probe Station](10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00119)
- 3D Printing
    - [Using Open-Source, 3D Printable Optical Hardware To Enhance Student Learning in the Instrumental Analysis Laboratory](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00480)
- Calorimetry
    - Measure \\(\Delta H^\circ\\) and \\( K \\) or activation energy using a simple calorimeter. See [Efficient Method for the Determination of the Activation Energy of the Iodide-Catalyzed Decomposition of Hydrogen Peroxide](https://doi.org/10.1021/ed500116g).
- Differential Scanning calorimetry
    - Not working well, but you could try to measure the melting point / purity of gallium, gallium-indium eutectic, and other low-melting point materials (chocolate?). There would certainly be some good applications, even if you data wouldn't be great.
