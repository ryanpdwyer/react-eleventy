# CHE 341 Lab: Spectroscopy or Characterization Project

This page lays out the goals and possible topics for the minor project.

### Goals
- Gain an in-depth understanding of a spectroscopy or characterization technique
- Design experiments and analyze data
- Write a technical report summarizing your progress so students in future years can build on what you learned


### Timeline

- **Friday Sep 18** Choose a topic and talk to me briefly so we have an idea of what you want to do in lab on Monday. I can also direct you to some other resources for your topic.
- **Monday Sep 21** By class time, plan out the experiments you want to do in lab. **Give me a list of materials needed so I can have then ready for you in lab.** In lab, make sure you have a good plan for next week. **If you need different materials, let me know.**



### Possible Topics


- UV-Vis spectroscopy
    - Measure the equilibrium constant of a chemical reaction.
    - Utilize the variable temperature add-on to measure the variation of the equilibrium constant with temperature, enabling you to determine the enthalpy change \\(\Delta H^\circ\\) and entropy change \\(\Delta S^\circ \\) for the reaction.
    - Measure the kinetics of a chemical reaction
    - Measure the activation energy of a chemical reaction
    - Determine the mechanism of a chemical reaction
    - Characterize the stability of gold nanoparticles created over the last 2 years by carefully measuring their spectra and determining their resistance to added salt
- Electrochemistry
    - The EPA action level for lead in drinking water is 15 parts per billion (ppb). Using anodic stripping voltammetry and a mercury-coated paper electrode, determine the limit of detection and quantification for this technique in our lab (method of standard additions). 
    - Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), or PEDOT, is a conductive polymer with electrochromic properties; depending on the applied voltage, the material can be transparent or a dark blue. Electrochemically grow a PEDOT film and investigate its properties (such as enhanced sensitivity to detect ascorbic acid).
    - Perform an electrochemical titration.
    - Coat an electrode with gold nanoparticles and investigate its utility as a sensor.
- Contact angle measurement
    - Modify the surface of glass, ITO, and gold materials - measure the contact angle
- Deposit thin films of PEDOT:PSS (orgnaic dispersion...)... Spin-coat PEDOT:PSS on glass and measure its surface properties.
- Deposit a \[Ru(bipy)<sub>3</sub>\]<sup>3+</sup> film and measure its electochemical and electroluminescent properties. See [Using Organic Light-Emitting Electrochemical Thin-Film Devices To Teach Materials Science](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ed081p1620).
- Calorimetry. Measure \\(\Delta H^\circ\\) and \\( K \\) or activation energy using a simple calorimeter. See [Efficient Method for the Determination of the Activation Energy of the Iodide-Catalyzed Decomposition of Hydrogen Peroxide](https://doi.org/10.1021/ed500116g).
