# Tools for searching, managing, and citing scientific literature

This page will briefly introduce you to these tools and provide links to more in-depth information to help you become more proficient using them over the course of the semester (**Learn more** boxes).

## Searching scientific literature

There are many sources listed on the library's [Chemistry Resources](https://www.mountunion.edu/academics/library/chemistry-resources) page.

### Search tools

Some of the most commonly used in biochemistry and chemistry are

## Reference management software

Reference management software tracks, manages, and organizes scientific papers, books, and web pages. The references can be cited in a lab report or paper, and the reference management software correctly numbers the citations and generates the bibliography. I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). Another option is [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/reference-manager).
Either way, the software has three components:

1.  An application containing a list of your articles, books, and other sources with different options for organizing, searching, and sorting. In Zotero, this looks like
<img class="img-fluid" alt="Zotero" src="/img/zotero.png">
The references can be sorted into collections (the folder symbols), tagged with keywords, and searched.
2.  A web browser plug-in that can (usually) download papers and create a reference from an article’s webpage. For Zotero, this icon changes depending on the webpage. If Zotero knows how to automatically import the article, it appears as a document icon:
<img class="img-fluid" alt="Zotero plug-in" src="/img/zotero-web-extension.png">
For an overview of how to import items into Zotero, see [Getting stuff into your library](https://www.zotero.org/support/getting_stuff_into_your_library). Note: For Mac users, only the beta version of Zotero is compatible with Safari—you have to use Chrome or Firefox instead to save directly from the browser. **Other ways to get references into Zotero:
    - The magic wand
    - Drag and drop the pdf into Zotero
3.  A plug-in for Word so that references and bibliographies can be imported and managed *automatically* (using the correct citation style, automatic numbering, etc...). In Zotero, this appears as its own menu in the ribbon:
<img class="img-fluid" alt="Zotero word plug-in" src="/img/zotero-word.png">
with options for adding citations, adding a bibliography, and preferences for managing how the citations and bibliography appear. For more information, see [Using the Zotero Word Plugin](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_usage).


For a more general overview of Zotero's features, see the [Quick Start Guide](https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide). For other questions, see the complete [documentation](https://www.zotero.org/support/start) (or feel free to ask me).

## Scientific literature search strategies

The best tools for scientific literature searches in biochemistry and chemistry are usually:

- [SciFinder](https://login.mt.opal-libraries.org/login?url=https://scifinder.cas.org/scifinder/login?TYPE=33554433&REALMOID=06-b7b15cf0-642b-1005-963a-830c809fff21&GUID=&SMAUTHREASON=0&METHOD=GET&SMAGENTNAME=-SM-wNXZ1RZQlZLQYv7NUS67HRPrsFE4zQPPc65bhKZLnR6OPJ9%2bos7bfMIDylPOZvbo&TARGET=-SM-http%3a%2f%2fscifinder%2ecas%2eorg%3a443%2fscifinder%2f)

- [Web of Science](https://login.mt.opal-libraries.org/login?url=https://app.webofknowledge.com)

A variety of search strategies are shown below:

### Searching by topic

The best way to do this depends on the par


### Searching by molecule

- See SciFinder's substance identifier tool.

### Forward literature searches: who has cited this article?

Both tools be used for **foward literature searches,** looking systematically at which other articles cite a particular paper. This will be very useful for your literature review---you can see where a field has gone since a particular important paper. In SciFinder, use Get Related Citations > Get Citing:

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/scifinder-forward-search.png" alt="SciFinder forward literature search">

In Web of Science, use the Times Cited box:

<img class="img-fluid" alt="Web of Science" src="/img/web-of-science-forward-search.png">

From there, the citations can be systematically analyzed, and refined in various ways. This can be an especially useful technique for a paper that helped launch a new field or sub-field (like Frances Arnold's paper ["Tuning the activity of an enzyme for unusual environments: sequential random mutagenesis of subtilisin E for catalysis in dimethylformamide,"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.90.12.5618) the first paper demonstrating directed evolution, for which she won half of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry). Since future papers in the field should always cite this original work, the cited references can help you see the current state of the field.



## Other useful tools 
### Accessing sources off-campus

<a href="javascript:void(location.href=%22http://mt.opal-libraries.org/login?url=%22+location.href);">UMU proxy</a>

Drag the link above to the bookmark toolbar or on mobile devices, bookmark any page, and edit the address by pasting in the following (including the semicolon at the end):

    javascript:void(location.href=%22http://mt.opal-libraries.org/login?url=%22+location.href);

To use the bookmarklet, nagivate to the journal article or off-campus resource you want to use, then click the bookmarklet to re-direct through the Mount Union library proxy.


### Looking up articles by citation

[Crossref](https://search.crossref.org/) is very useful for this (Google has gotten much better at this, but still sometimes fails to find the correct citation). Just paste the citation, and it should return the correct article at or near the top of the search results.
