# The future of AI: GPT-3

With [Write with Transformer](https://transformer.huggingface.co) or [Talk to Transformer](https://app.inferkit.com/demo), you can see how large neural nets can generate text based on your prompts. These models use neural networks with between 1 billion (Write with transformer) and 11 billion parameters (Talk to transformer).

GPT-3, which was released last summer, takes the same approach, but increases the size of the neural network dramatically, to 175 billion parameters! Here's some examples of demos people have made using this gigantic language model:

Here's two different models that will help us investigate GPT-3: [Shortly Read](https://www.shortlyread.com/) and [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io).




<!-- Using Talk to Transformer, here's the output:

**Summarize the plot of J.K. Rowlingâ€™s Harry Potter.**

**Harry Potter is the story of** Harry Potter, who, at the age of 11, is left a large family fortune by his parents, but is expelled from school for trying to uncover the great mystery of the death of James and Lily Potter. Harry is then taken in by the Dursley family, who have been keeping him under the watchful eye of Petunia, the overbearing matriarch, but which make his life miserable. Harry then goes on to live with the Weasley family, and before long, he is a celebrated wizard. -->
