# Tools for Improving your Literature Review, Presentation, or Poster

Newly updated, the [ACS Guide to Scholarly Communication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/book/10.1021/acsguide) has great general information on formatting, tables, figures, etc.

Look back at [Searching and Citing Literature](/lit) as well - now that you've done some relatively intensive searching, I would highly reccomend looking at that 
## Making Figures

Making your own figures to explain / diagram experiments, syntheses, etc is highly reccomended! 

### Scientific Illustration

- [BioRender](https://biorender.com) Stylish - a nice option for experimental protocols, biochemistry experiments, quickly making decent looking nanoparticles, etc...
- [Chemix](https://chemix.org) Simpler, with a few more free features.

### Chemical structures or reactions

- **ChemDraw** We have licenses on some computer in the 3rd floor Bracy computer room. There is also a 2 week [free trial option](http://scistore.cambridgesoft.com/ScistoreSoftwareDisplay.aspx?Trial=Trial) if you want to use it to draw a bunch of reactions without having to use those computers.
    - Note: The defaults are not good! Use ACS 1996 settings.
- [MarvinJS](https://marvinjs-demo.chemaxon.com/latest/) A free alternative - a nice set of defaults for organic-chemistry-style structures is

- [Presentation Tips in Chemistry](/img/presentation-tips.pptx) by Christine Le. See the end of the presentation for nice advice on drawing structures.

### General purpose illustration

- **PowerPoint:** Good for simple figures and diagrams. Make sure that your lines are thick enough, and experiment with the different 2D / 3D shape options to see what looks best.
- [Vectr](https://vectr.com/) or [Canva](https://canva.com) 
- [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com) Icons!
- If you have drawing abilities, hand-drawn (or with a Surface / iPad pencil) can be a nice touch in places!

## Making Tables

- Excel is a good choice for laying things out initially; you will want your final tables to be imported into Word and styled nicely, but it is usually easier to lay things out at first in Excel.
