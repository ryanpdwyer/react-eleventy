<p>The University of Mount Union’s Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry degree is approved by the American Chemical Society (ACS) Committee and prepares students for rewarding careers in biotechnology, molecular biology, pharmacology, and other health and medical sciences.</p>
<p>Faculty at the University are dedicated professionals committed to helping students excel and gain real-world knowledge to pursue careers or graduate school. Small class sizes place a strong emphasis on the importance of the relationship between the student and professor, allowing them to work together to foster an environment suitable for learning.<br><br></p>
<h2 class="heading-6 margin-b purple"><strong>Biochemistry Major Quick Facts </strong></h2>
<p>The biochemistry degree requires a total of 120 credits, with 60 credits being specific to the biochemistry major. Additionally, students will need to complete the Integrative Core, the University’s general education program designed to help students explore areas outside of their field of interest and develop essential skills for a rewarding career. The biochemistry major offers proven benefits to students looking to pursue this program at Mount Union.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Numerous opportunities for real-world research – independent, with faculty, and with peers</li>
<li>100 percent of biochemistry majors from the classes of 2012-2016 were able to start a degree-required career or were accepted to graduate school within six months of graduation (from a survey with 82 percent self-reporting)</li>
<li>Opportunities in the biochemistry field are projected to grow 37 percent over the course of the next decade</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The four-year biochemistry major will allow students to not only receive classroom experience, but real-world research with fellow students and faculty. Students have access to innovative lab equipment from the beginning of the program, allowing them to get a feel for how professionals in the field work.<br><br></p>
