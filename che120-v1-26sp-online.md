# E1 What's in the Water?

In this lab, you will identify unknown pollutants in a sample of water using infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

Make sure you've watched the pre-lab video before starting the experiment.

Look at the pre-lab assignment in the lab manual (pages 6-7). Try to answer the questions on your own, then look at the following video to see the solutions.

## Predicting IR and NMR Spectra

The following section is designed to help you practice using IR and NMR to identify your unknown. We'll consider an unknown sample that could be one of the three molecules shown below:

### IR

Look at the molecules and determine what functional groups are in each molecule. This will tell you where you expect to see peaks in the IR spectrum.

If you had trouble with these, here's an explanation of each solution.

### NMR

Look at the molecules and determine how many different types of hydrogens there are, and the ratio between them, which will tell you about the number of peaks and the ratio of areas of the peaks in the NMR spectrum.

These can be a little trickier than the IR. Here's an explanation of each solution.

## Identifying an unknown using IR and NMR spectra

Here's the IR and NMR spectra for one of the 3 compounds you looked at above.

#### IR

#### NMR

<div id="u1"></div>


The region below 1400 cm<sup>-1</sup> is called the fingerprint region - many compounds have many possible peaks in this range, so this region of the spectrum is less definitive. A peak in the C-Cl or C-Br range should probably be interpreted as indicating the **possible** presence of one of those functional groups. You could indicate that by using a question mark in your table. Remember that you always need to consider all the possible evidence when identifying the unknown.

**For your formal report, you will need to explain the reasoning behind your choices.** Here's an example of talking through the reasoning for this example.

### Results Worksheet

There are 15 possible compounds each of your unknowns could be (shown in the lab manual on page ). Go through the same steps as above to identify your unknowns. Remember that you can print the [lab handout](/img/v4lab.pdf) or type your answers in the [Word version](/img/4vlab-worksheet.docx).

1. Fill out Table 1.2. Predict the IR spectrum by determining which functional groups are present in each molecule.

2. Fill out Table 1.3. Predict the NMR spectrum by determining how many peaks (types of Hydrogen atoms) and the ratio of areas for each molecule.

3. If your tables are not filled out correctly, you will not be able to identify your unknowns. Here's some questions about the tables to check that you are on the right track.

<div id="checkTable">
</div>

  **If you have trouble with any of these, ask your lab (or lecture) instructor for help.**

1. Now use the experimental data from the spectra to fill out Tables 1.4 and 1.5.

5. Use the information from each type of spectroscopy to identify your 3 unknowns. **Write down a little bit about your reasoning for each unknown so that you remember it when you go to write your formal lab report.**


## Formal Lab Report

Once your lab instructor has confirmed that you have successfully identified your unknowns, you are ready to write the formal lab report for this experiment.
Your report will need to include

**Abstract**: The purpose, a little bit about the procedure, and the key results of the experiment.

**Experimental:** A short paragraph (2-3 sentences) with key experimental details about how the spectra were collected (what instrument, etc). See the video above for this information.

**Results:** This section will include

- The tables you filled in for the results worksheet. Copy the completed tables from your results worksheet or the blank tables from [this document](https://mountunion.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/CHE120Lab2/EcRcYjj9C-RLpIlXpYulzCgBe_Z3syZWYxIwbQtWI05MQA?e=LKTnR6). Remember to add labels: **Table 1. Descriptive Title, Table 2. Another descriptive title**, etc.
- The IR and NMR spectra of your unknowns. Remember to add captions with numbers and titles: **Figure 1. IR Spectrum of 32345**, **Figure 2. NMR Spectrum of 32345**, etc.
- **Paragraphs of text** guiding the reader through the tables and figures, explaining what is contained in each. You should also **identify the unknowns.**

**Discussion**: Discuss the points below from the lab manual in paragraphs of text.

1. Provide a full explanation of how you determined the identity of each unknown compound, citing specific examples from your results.  In particular, is there any ambiguity or uncertainty in the identification of an unknown?  (i.e. Were you able to narrow it to two or three compounds but no further?).  Be sure to cite specific evidence from your data tables and figures (spectra) to facilitate your discussion.

2. Briefly discuss the implications of the presence of each of the compounds that you identified in the drinking water supply and any potential human health effects. **You will need to cite outside sources here in ACS Style.**

3. Briefly discuss the implications of the presence of each of the compounds that you identified in the surface waters and any potential environmental effects. **You will need to cite outside sources here in ACS Style.**

**References:** Reference the lab handout (including the three lab instructors as authors) and sources you consulted to discuss human health and environmental impacts of the three compounds you identified.
