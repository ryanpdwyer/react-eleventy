### Reading

- Read *You Look Like a Thing and I Love You* (Shane), Introduction and Chapter 1

### Written Reflection

For this part of the class, you will be asked to submit reflections on the reading and participate during in-class discussions and activities.

The reflections are designed to give you regular practice to improve your writing. Write your reflection in advance so that you have time to proofread it carefully to make sure it is clearly written and grammatically correct. **Do not write your reflection just before the deadline and submit without proofreading.**

The prompt is meant to guide your reading and reflection-you are free to choose any of these bullet points as the basis of your reflection or to focus on another area of the book that you found interesting, surprising, funny, unexpected, etc. **Your reflections should be 200 to 300 words long (roughly 2/3 to 1 page long double spaced).**

**Prompt:** The key ideas presented in the reading are the 5 principles of AI weirdness (in the introduction) and the 4 rules of AI doom (in Chapter 1).

- From the book, the news, your everyday life, or any AI model you've used before, analyze a case where an AI fails using the principles/rules.
- What do you think of the principles and rules? Are there any that particularly stand out to you?
- Describe one principle and one rule that is the most interesting or surprising to you. 
- Or write about any other part of the reading you had a strong reaction to!
