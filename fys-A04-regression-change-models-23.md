# Regression models and changing classifier models

## Goals

- Build a regression model in Wekinator
- Compare the results you get training at least two different classifier models

### Tasks

1. Build a regression model in Wekinator, using *2 inputs* (Avatar_2Inputs or similar) and at least **2 outputs**.
2. Build another classifier model with **3 or more classes** using the Classifier Explorer (in `wekinator_examples/teaching_examples/ClassifierExplorer`).
    - Record training data, train, and draw decision boundaries for 2 different models; take screenshots of both.
    - Compare and contrast the results. Do you think one is better/worse?


### Walkthough videos

For help completing the steps, see the following videos:

<h4> Regression model </h4>

**For my regression model, I chose to make the output color match the input color.** Feel free to use the same for yours - or be creative if you have another idea.

Don't worry if your model doesn't work perfectly - it's harder to make the colors match exactly everywhere.

If you'd like to change the regression model, see the video below:

<h4>Changing classifier models</h4>

Here's an example of a classifier. Make sure you use **3 or more classes** in your model:

## Submitting (during class)

Label your models and paste screenshots of your classifiers into the Word document: [FYS Classifier model comparison](https://mountunion-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/dwyerry_mountunion_edu/Ef-uyf4r95FKnolavcBmJbYB9-TZ_bO_5pYqb-x6JxHPCw?e=3DvElX)
