# A1 Excel help

If you're having trouble completing the problem in Excel, it might be useful to think through steps like:


1. **What are the inputs / given information for the calculation?**
2. **What are the outputs / final answer?**
3. **Steps?**

<button onclick="show('hidden-answers');" class="btn btn-primary">Show answers</button>

<div id="hidden-answers" markdown="1" hidden>

1. **What are the inputs / given information for the calculation?** The moles of each molecule (say 2 moles H₂, 0.5 mol HD, 1 mol D₂ as we used in class)
2. **What are the outputs / final answer?** The equilibrium (most probable distribution) moles of each molecule.
3. **Steps?** We can use the same steps we used in class (or shown on p16 of the book).  From the initial moles, we can calculate the moles of each type of atom (H and D), then the probability of each type of atom, then the probability of each type of molecule, then finally the moles of each type of molecule.
