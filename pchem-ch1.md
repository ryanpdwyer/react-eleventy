## Probability: Distributions and chemical equilibrium

### Goals

- Use "randomly shuffled cards" model and probability to determine equilibrium composition for isotope exchange reactions

### Video

Note: The same content is covered in the book, Chapter 1 pages 6-17. Use the book and/or the video (whichever you prefer).

The following video finishes the chapter, going over the procedure for calculating the equilibrium amounts of each species (and the equilibrium constant) for any isotope exchange reaction.

### Questions

These are ungraded questions to check your understanding of the material.

Consider the case where 2 moles of H<sub>2</sub>,  0.5 moles of HD, and 1 mole of D<sub>2</sub> are placed in a container and the system comes to equilibrium. 

Enter your answers as decimals not fractions (0.5 rather than 1/2).
