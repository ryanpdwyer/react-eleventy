## FYS Final Project and Presentation

**Goal:** Apply what you have learned during the semester about AI to one final topic. Make an engaging presentation that tells the story of what you were able to learn/accomplish.

Individual is fine if you prefer, but I'd strongly reccomend working **with a partner.**

## Topic Ideas?


### Future AI and Science Fiction

Science fiction writing is a great way to think about future AI. Also great to see how things can be analyzed with our AI Weirdness principles.

- [The Lifecycle of Software Objects](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/voices.uchicago.edu/dist/8/644/files/2017/08/Chiang-Lifecycle-of-Software-Objects-q3tsuw.pdf) Very immersive story.


### AI in Sports

### AI in Writing

Try writing a story (or something else) in conjungtion with the AI; how does it go?
See [How Iâ€™m using AI to write my next novel](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/8/30/20840194/ai-art-fiction-writing-language-gpt-2).

### General AI

- [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com) Go back and build a new Teachable machine model; connect it with a cool output.
- [LeapMotion](https://www.ultraleap.com/tracking/) Try out our LeapMotion handtracker to make a processing model.

- Processing - go all the way back to the beginning and work on Processing; consider trying out some of the different inputs available -->
