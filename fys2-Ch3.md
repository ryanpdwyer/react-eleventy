## Goals


- such as:
    - Deep learning, evolutionary algorithms, optimization, RNN, LSTM, CNN

<!--  Why is this important? The learning isn't magic.
      Computers are still just following your directions blindly.
 -->

### Reading

- Shane Chapter 3: How does it actually learn?

### Writing

The prompt is meant to guide your reading and reflection-you are free to choose any of these bullet points as the basis of your reflection or to focus on another area of the book that you found interesting, surprising, funny, unexpected, etc. **Your reflections should be 200 to 300 words long (roughly 2/3 to 1 page long double spaced).**

**Prompts:** Discuss one of the examples of AI and machine learning discussed in the chapter, including any interesting applications, anything you learned, or anything about our AI Weirdness principles / Signs of AI Doom that's relevant
- Neural networks
- Markov chains (feel free to try some of the experiments using your phone's auto-correct)
- Random forests
- Evolutionary algorithms
- Generative adversarial networks (GANs)

As usual, feel free to reflect on something else of interest if you prefer!




<!-- Do this in class. Choose one of the applications to reflect on (200-300 words)

-->
<!-- **Prompt:** Choose a potential topic for the second paper / presentation. Using some of what you learned in Chapter 3, describe how your AI learns. -->

**Due by Tuesday October 20th at 12 pm** to the [D2L Dropbox](#)
