## Goals

- Build a regression model in Wekinator
- Compare the results you get training at least two different classifier models

### Tasks

1. Build a regression model in Wekinator, using *2 inputs* (Avatar_2Inputs or similar) and at least **2 outputs**.
2. Build another classifier model with **3 or more classes** using the Classifier Explorer (in `wekinator_examples/teaching_examples/ClassifierExplorer`).
    - Record training data, train, and draw decision boundaries for 2 different models; take screenshots of both.
    - Compare and contrast the results. Do you think one is better/worse?

Record a 1-2 minute video explaining:

- For the regression model:
    1. Explain what you want the model to do. 
    2. Show it running. How well does it work?
- For the classifier explorer
    1. Show the screen shots you took (and which is which model).
    2. Explain which model you think worked better.


### Walkthough videos

For help completing the assignment, see the following video for part 1 (the regression model):

**For my regression model, I chose to make the output color match the input color.** Feel free to use the same for yours - or be creative if you have another idea.
