## FYS Final Project and Presentation

**Goal:** Apply what you have learned during the semester about AI to one final topic. Make an engaging presentation that tells the story of what you were able to learn/accomplish.

Individual is fine if you prefer, but I'd strongly reccomend working **with a partner.**

## Topic Ideas?


### Future AI and Science Fiction

Science fiction writing is a great way to think about future AI. In your presentation, you would analyze the story using what you know about AI (AI Weirdness principles, etc).

- [The Lifecycle of Software Objects](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/voices.uchicago.edu/dist/8/644/files/2017/08/Chiang-Lifecycle-of-Software-Objects-q3tsuw.pdf) Very immersive story.
- Other short stories could be a good fit to...

### AI in Sports

A lot of these you could frame as product reviews: are they worth it? Is the AI adding something or is it just a buzzword?

- [TopTen.AI reccomendations](https://topten.ai/best-ai-fitness-and-trainer-apps-review/) Some interesting ones here
    - Several iOS apps that could be interesting: [Exer Plank](https://www.exer.ai/plank), [Artifit](https://artifit.app/), [Powermove](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/powermove-a-i-home-workouts/id1506826636), [FitnessAI - no free version but does have a 7-day free trial](https://www.fitnessai.com/)
- [Gatorade Sweat patch](https://www.gatorade.com/gx/sweatpatch) One potential group could try this out (I have two patches - you could get more if needed/desired)

### AI and photos / drawing

- [Five options](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-photo-editors-transform-pictures-without-knowing-image-editing/)
    - Some are web-based, others are phone-based
- [AutoDraw - use Google QuickDraw to make your own drawings](https://www.autodraw.com/) This is another fun one!

### AI in Writing

Try writing a story (or something else) in conjungtion with the AI; how does it go? How good are these products / what is the future of AI-assisted writing? 
See [How Iâ€™m using AI to write my next novel](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/8/30/20840194/ai-art-fiction-writing-language-gpt-2).

### AI in Gaming

- Cool idea; I don't have any particular good things to try.

### Building your own AI

- [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com) Go back and build a new Teachable machine model! Connect it with a cool output.
- [LeapMotion](https://www.ultraleap.com/tracking/) Try out our LeapMotion handtracker to make a processing model
- [Processing: Audio](https://vimeo.com/276021078) Sound classifier, many other options here.


<!-- 
- Processing - go all the way back to the beginning and work on Processing; consider trying out some of the different inputs available -->
