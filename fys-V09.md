# Building an AI Project: Interesting Outputs

## Goals

- Connect your AI model to different outputs
- Modify the outputs, which requires programming (in contrast to machine learning / AI)

## Teachable Machine Models

- Make sure you have a url: Export Model, then "Upload my Model", then copy the resulting link.

- You can use your URL in Wekinator Machine or directly in a Web example below.

### Web Examples

- [Pose Model Music](/tm-pose/)
- [Image Model Music](/tm-image/)
