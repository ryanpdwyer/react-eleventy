## Experiment 3: Data Analysis

We have the lab period to perform data analysis and calculations, but it's useful to have a few things done beforehand.

1. Make sure everyone has all of the data from each experiment.
2. Make sure you have an Excel file with
    a) Your standard curve from week 1
    b) Your absorbance versus time data from your 3 experiments.
3. Attempt the following 3 pre-lab calculation questions (listed below)

The video below gives an overview of the 3 key calculations to attempt before Monday:

## Pre-lab calculations

1. For every 1 mole of acetaminophen, how many moles of ferroin should be produced? 
2. Using your data from Week 1, calculate the concentration of the initial acetaminophen stock solution (see the video for the stoichiometry steps) - if you did all of the labwork and calculations right, it should be close to the 0.0040 M acetaminophen listed on the reagent bottle. This one is tougher, but should be doable; remember to write out the calculation in your lab notebook so we can help you during the lab period.
3. Using the standard rate of release conversion procedure, how many milligrams of acetaminophen would be released (in the full 750 mL of solution) if the diluted ferroin sample in your 10 mL volumetric flask had a concentration of 1.0 M? This one is a little tougher still; but try it out - it will help make it easier to quickly correct any mistakes during lab next week.

That's it! We'll meet to continue working through the data analysis in Bracy 21 on Monday.
