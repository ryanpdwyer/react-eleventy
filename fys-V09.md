# Building an AI Project: Interesting Outputs

**Previous:** See [Week 4: Building an AI Model Project](/fys-V07-23) for an overview of the steps from week 4.

## Goals

- Connect your AI model to different outputs
- Modify the outputs, which requires programming (in contrast to machine learning / AI)

## Teachable Machine Models

- Make sure you have a url: Export Model, then "Upload my Model", then copy the resulting link.

- You can use your URL in Wekinator Machine or directly in a Web example below.

### Web Examples

- [Pose Model Instruments](/tm-pose/)
- [Image Model Instruments](/tm-image/)
- [Pose Model Spotify](/tm-pose-spotify2/)
- [Image Model Spotify](/tm-image-spotify/)
- [Pose Model Doodle Jump](https://editor.p5js.org/ryanpdwyer/full/wRpcePuXj)
- [Audio Model Doodle Jump](https://editor.p5js.org/ryanpdwyer/full/vDYzcd2kI)
