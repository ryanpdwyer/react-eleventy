# A1: Setting up your computer

### Goals

- Install software that will help you get started building your own AI applications.
- Take screenshots-this will be useful to share your work and diagnose bugs going forward!

Here are instructions for installing the applications you'll need in this class on your computer. If you have a Mac, go [here](#mac).

## Windows

If you have any installation issues, take a screenshot (Windows+Shift+S) showing the problem and include it in your assignment.

1. [Office 365](https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx) Microsoft Office is included free with your University of Mount Union ID.

2. [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/downloads/). Wekinator will let you perform machine learning to connect all sorts of inputs and outputs on your computer. Download the application, unzip it, and run the installer. Add a shortcut to the desktop and/or pin to the start menu so you can start it easily.<button class="btn btn-link" onclick="show('windows-wekinator-video')">Need help installing Wekinator?

[Processing](https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases/download/processing-1293-4.3/processing-4.3-macos-aarch64.zip) Download the Mac version (you probably want the *Apple Silicon* version, linked first - otherwise choose the Intel version [here](https://processing.org/download/)) and move the application to your Applications folder. Right-click and open the application the first time, just like you did with Wekinator. <button class="btn btn-link" onclick="show('mac-processing-video')">Need help? Watch the video below:</button>

<h2 id="assignment">A2 Installing programs</h2>

Create a Microsoft Word document with your name at the top. Show that you've installed the applications by pasting the following **2** screenshots into a Word document:


1. To show that you have Wekinator installed, launch the application and paste a screenshot of the screen that shows up in your document:

![Wekinator inputs screen](/img/fys-wekinator.png)

2. **To show that you have Processing and the Wekinator Example Bundle, open processing and the file `welcome` in the `wekinator_examples/welcome` folder. Press the Play button, enter your name, and paste a screenshot of the window that shows up in your document:**

![Processing welcome screen](/img/welcome-picture.png)


Here's an example of me doing both on Windows:

4. **If you had any issues installing/opening any of the applications, include a screenshot showing your problem, and/or contact me via [email](mailto:dwyerry@mountunion.edu). We can make sure you get everything installed correctly for the next class meeting.**


5. **Submit the assignment to the [Dropbox folder]** on D2L (10 pts).
