Through the Department of Energy Laboratory Equipment Donation Program, we were donated a Solartron 1287A Potentiostat (original cost $16,500!). 
The instrument will be used to introduce interdisciplinary solar cell design/characterization activities into undergraduate chemistry and physics labs and undergraduate research. The instrument performs a  variety of advanced electrochemical experiments that will help students better characterize solar cells and biosensors they design and fabricate in lab and research.
