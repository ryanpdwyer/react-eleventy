We received a startup allocation of computational resources (estimated market value $1000!) from [XSEDE](https://xsede.org) to build AI and machine learning tools for education on the  [Jetstream Cloud](https://jetstream-cloud.org/about/index.php)!

This will build on our work last year for the First Year Seminar class *AI for Everyone*, where we wrote the [Wekinator Machine](https://github.com/ryanpdwyer/wekinator-machine) program to connect [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org) to Google's [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com).



<!-- **Proposal Abstract:**

No-code machine learning applications such as [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org) and Google's [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com) introduce students to machine learning and artificial intelligence in an approachable format. In particular, Wekinator is modular, accepting inputs from and sending outputs to a variety of programs. Last year we wrote a program, , to connect Teachable Machine's intuitive webcam and microphone-based models to Wekinator or Wekinator output programs. This program was used as part of the first year seminar class *AI for Everyone* in which students built their own machine learning model and connected it to an output of their choosing.

With this allocation, we propose expanding on this prior work by building simple web interfaces to Tensorflow or PyTorch models. We will use the same empowering, modular approach as Wekinator that allows students to connect their models to various outputs. Our previous efforts in this direction have been limited by the necessity of running all code client-side in the browser. This allocation will allow Tensorflow, Pytorch, or other machine learning libraries to be trained or run server-side, enabling students to build and experiment with richer models directly in the browser. -->
