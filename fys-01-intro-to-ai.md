# Introduction to AI

The goal of this class is to get you hands-on experience with artificial intelligence so that you can see what AI could do for you. You can see applications of artificial intelligence in voice assistants (Siri, Google, Alexa...), search results, "Recommendation algorithms" used to serve ads to you based on your browsing / purchasing history / demographic information. These are all instances of Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) - where computers have expertise in a given narrow area, such as recommending what products you might want to buy. The science-fiction idea of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a computer that has broad knowledge and abilities to reason at a human or smarter than human level, is still quite a ways off, if it ever happens.

The recent advances in artificial intelligence advances are powered by *machine learning*. In machine learning, you give a computer some data and a particular learning *algorithm*, and it determines how to perform the task on its own. This is in contrast to how computers normally are programmed, where you tell the computer the exact steps to perform. 

I'll show you some examples of little AI programs I've build with the tools I'm going to show you.

1) Sit / stand...
2) Control volume, tone, based on hand position?
3) Start / stop music control?

What do you think of when you think of artificial intelligence? (This could include applications in everyday life, movies, books, etc...)
What do you think the future of artificial intelligence will be? (Robot overlords, advances in science and medicine, small advances on what we have now...).
