## Goals

- Build a regression model in Wekinator
- Compare the results you get training at least two different models?

### Tasks

1. Build a regression model in Wekinator, using 2 inputs (Avatar) and at least 2 outputs.
2. Build another classifier model with 3 or more classes using the Classifier Explorer (in `wekinator_examples/teaching_examples/ClassifierExplorer`).
    - Record training data, train, and draw decision boundaries for 2 different models; take screenshots of both.
    - Compare and contrast the results. Do you think one is better/worse?

Record a 2-3 minute video explaining what you did:
1. Explain what you want the model to do.
2.
