<!-- To do: Consider making this check-in anonymous, or adding another college check-in here... -->

## Goals

- Learn what specific models and algorithms Wekinator is using to do AI
- Learn how to change the classifier model Wekinator is using

### Check your understanding

Consider the following data trying to make a classifier to detect "in the box" (class 1, red) versus not in the box (class 2, blue). Unfortunately, the training data had an error - there was a point in the box mislabeled as outside of the box (this is common in real-world AI and machine learning!).

Here are pictures showing two different models trained on the same training data:
