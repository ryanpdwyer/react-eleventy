### Outline

- Part 1: Building a simple AI in Wekinator.
    - Try out one of the inputs, build something interesting
    - Regression, classification, time models
        - Lots of different potential models that could be used for each purpose
- Part 2: AI Weirdness
    - A little more theory / background:
        - Ch 3 introduces lots of different types of AIs
        - Optimize an objective function
            - Predict this data
        - Generative models: Different from what we had before...
        - Adversarial models: A new learning strategy...
        - Image models, computational photography: Convolutional Neural networks
        - Voice to text models?
        - Deep learning: Need to learn lots of intermediate stuff...
    - Critical eye on "hype"
    - Analyze an existing AI application...
        - How is it built?
        - Where does it succeed?
        - Where does it fail?
        - How does that tie back to AI principles?
        - Do some research...
        - Ethical implications of AI?
- Part 3: Build something new, and/or read something and/or write something
    - `ml5.js` and `p5.js`?
    - 
    - Improve your part 1 project
    - Final takeaway
