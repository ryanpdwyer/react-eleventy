## Goals

- Practice writing and editing
- Connect AI / machine learning theory to applications

# A3 Essay: Reviewing an AI application - identifying classifiers and regression in the wild



Choose an application of AI / machine learning. It could be from the list of applications below or any others you can think of or find on your own. Write a one-page double-spaced essay that reviews the application for your classmates. Make sure to include

1) A descriptive title
2) A clear overall assessment (thesis/purpose) of this AI application
3) An explanation of the application and its purpose
4) Describe the AI model specifically (what inputs? Is the output a **classifier, regression, both, or neither?** Anything interesting about how the model was trained?)
5) In your assessment, make sure to include specific details about what your found interesting, or frustrating, or boring, or exciting about the application
6) Links to 1 or more sources that you used (videos, websites, etc...)
    - You can use APA or MLA format, or just include the link.
7) Includes an image if appropriate.

A good essay will be organized and well-written. What is well-written? Check that your essay 

- Is understandable to your audience, your fellow classmates
- Develops logically, using effective and smooth transitions
- Engages the reader, making points clearly and concisely

Also, check to make sure your post avoids these **critical mistakes:**

1) Sentence fragments (incomplete sentences)
2) Run-on sentences (comma splices and fused sentences)
3) Sentence sprawl (Long sentences that contain many clauses which makes it hard to infer the meaning that the writer is trying to get across because all of those extra words and clauses get in the way of the reader's comprehension-like this sentence!)

Also check for basic spelling errors, typos, and capitalization errors.

Feel free to use AI tools to assist your writing, but note that they needed to be cited (see [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt))and **double-checked** for accuracy. Your review is also not effective if it is largely direct quotes from a large language model.
